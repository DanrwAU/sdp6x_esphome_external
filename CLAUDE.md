# ESPHome SDP6x Component Development Log

## Project Overview
Created a custom ESPHome component for the Sensirion SDP6x series differential pressure sensors.

2. **Existing SDP6x Implementation**: https://github.com/EngineerTony/Sensirion_SDP6x_pressure_sens
3. **ESPHome I2C Sensor Example**: https://github.com/dyptan-io/esphome-i2c-sensor (chirp sensor)

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Implementation
- Created basic ESPHome component structure
- Implemented I2C communication with SDP6x sensor
- Added CRC validation for data integrity
- Created configuration schema for pressure and temperature sensors

**Files Created:**
- `components/sdp6x/__init__.py` - Component metadata and dependencies
- `components/sdp6x/sensor.py` - Sensor platform configuration
- `components/sdp6x/sdp6x.h` - Header file with class definition
- `components/sdp6x/sdp6x.cpp` - Implementation with I2C communication
- `README.md` - Documentation and usage examples

### Phase 2: Structure Refinement
- Added proper `sensor.py` file for ESPHome sensor platform
- Updated `__init__.py` to follow ESPHome component conventions
- Added CODEOWNERS and AUTO_LOAD directives

### Phase 3: Professional Enhancement (Based on Chirp Example)
Analyzed the chirp sensor implementation and enhanced our component to match professional standards:

**Key Improvements:**
1. **Configuration Schema**
   - Added raw value output options for both pressure and temperature
   - Enhanced validation and default values
   - Better parameter organization

2. **Code Structure**
   - Added Config struct for state management
   - Implemented proper component lifecycle (started flag)
   - Enhanced error handling with status warnings

3. **I2C Communication**
   - Added enum for command definitions
   - Improved CRC validation with individual segment checks
   - Better error reporting and logging

4. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Raw value support (`raw: true/false` configuration)
   - Comprehensive logging (debug, verbose, config)
   - State management for reliable operation
   - Better sensor value processing

5. **Documentation**
   - Complete configuration examples
   - Hardware connection details
   - Troubleshooting section
   - Multiple usage patterns

## Technical Implementation Details

### I2C Communication Protocol
- **Address**: 0x25 (default)
- **Commands**:
  - Start Continuous Measurement: 0x3603
  - Stop Continuous Measurement: 0x3FF9
  - Read Measurement: 0xE000

### Data Format
- 9 bytes total response
- Bytes 0-2: Pressure (2 bytes + 1 CRC)
- Bytes 3-5: Temperature (2 bytes + 1 CRC)
- Bytes 6-8: Scale Factor (2 bytes + 1 CRC)

### Sensor Calculations
- **Pressure**: `raw_pressure / scale_factor` = Pascals
- **Temperature**: `raw_temperature / 200.0` = Celsius

### CRC Validation
- Uses CRC-8 with polynomial 0x31
- Validates each data segment independently
- Provides detailed error reporting on CRC failures

## Component Features
- Differential pressure measurement in Pascals
- Temperature measurement in Celsius
- I2C communication with comprehensive error handling
- CRC validation for data integrity
- Raw value output option
- Configurable update intervals
- Professional ESPHome integration
- Comprehensive logging and debugging

## Current Status
✅ Component fully implemented and enhanced
✅ Documentation completed
✅ Ready for testing
⏳ **Awaiting approval to push to GitHub**

## Repository
- **Target**: https://github.com/DanrwAU/sdp6x_esphome_external.git
- **Status**: Local changes ready, not yet pushed per user request

## Usage Example
```yaml
external_components:
  - source: github://DanrwAU/sdp6x_esphome_external
    components: [sdp6x]

sensor:
  - platform: sdp6x
    differential_pressure:
      name: "Differential Pressure"
      raw: false
    temperature:
      name: "Temperature" 
      raw: false
    update_interval: 60s
```

## Next Steps
- Push updated component to GitHub when approved
- Test with actual SDP6x hardware
- Consider additional features based on user feedback
